# Morse encryptor/decryptor

## Description
This is a morse encryptor/decryptor. It can translate morse code to our language, and our language to morse code.

## Installation
Python 3.0 is required.

## Roadmap

For future releases, I will implement a Tkinter to have a graphic window, which will make my encryptor/decryptor more intuitive.
